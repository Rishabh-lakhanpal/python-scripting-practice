# üêç Python Scripting Practice

This repository contains daily scripting and automation practice tasks, along with Git and GitHub exercises. It is part of my journey to strengthen my automation and DevOps skills.

##  Folder Structure

### `ScriptPractice/`
Small, real-world Python scripts using modules like `os`, `sys`, `re`, and `psutil`.

- `cpu_usage.py`: Script to monitor CPU usage using psutil.
- `rearrange1.py` & `rearrange2.py`: Demonstration of regex and diff/patch usage for refactoring code.
- `cpu_usage.patch`: Patch file created using `diff -u` and applied using `patch`.
- `rename_txt_to_md.py`: Renames `.txt` files to `.md`.
- `word_count.py`: Counts number of words in a file.
- `test_files/`: Sample `.md` files for testing.

### `Practice/`
Interactive beginner-to-intermediate automation scripts with input/output handling.

- `Votingeligible.py`: Check voting eligibility based on age input.
- `number_guess_game.py`: Guess the random number in limited attempts.
- `password_strength_checker.py`: Checks password against basic rules using regex.
- `rain_checker.py`: Weather-based decision logic (logs rain decision).
- `system_health_check.py`: Logs system health metrics.
- `user_register.py`: User registration system that stores data in CSV.
- `logs/`: Logs generated by health and weather scripts.
- `users/users.csv`: Stores registered users with timestamps.

## üõ†Ô∏èTools & Skills Used

- **Python 3**
- Standard Modules: `os`, `sys`, `re`, `shutil`, `psutil`, `csv`, `datetime`
- Linux Commands: `diff`, `patch`, `chmod`
- Git & GitHub (SSH-based workflow)
- Concepts: Regex, logging, file manipulation, user input, patching
- Version control best practices

##  Goals

- Practice writing **reusable Python scripts**
- Build automation tasks based on **real-world problems**
- Master **Git operations** (`add`, `commit`, `push`, `diff`, `patch`, branches)
- Build habit of **clean scripting**, logging, and versioning
